The serialization and deserialization functions can be accessed independently in the respectively named folders.

There is a whole available for controlling the motors in the Motor_Control_GUI folder. User can either clone the can_server and python gui separately and then run the compiled can_server in one terminal and the python gui in another OR the user can clone the single pyinstaller packaged application; it can be found in the "dist/" folder in the Motor_Control_GUI directory.
